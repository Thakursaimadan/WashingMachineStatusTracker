# Washing Machine Status Tracker

This is a **Washing Machine Status Tracker** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform allows students in a hostel to check whether a washing machine is free or occupied, and admins can view user logs and feedback for each machine.

## Features

### User (Students):
- **Check Availability**: View the status of washing machines in real-time (free or occupied).
- **Feedback**: Submit feedback for the washing machines.

### Admin:
- **View User Logs**: Access detailed logs of users for each washing machine.
- **Feedback Management**: View feedback submitted by users.
  
## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB**: For storing washing machine status, user logs, and feedback.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building the API.
- **React**: Frontend framework for creating the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for handling server-side logic.
